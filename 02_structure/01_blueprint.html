<!--
Let's practice HTML structure by creating a file called blueprint.html.

Make sure to add the following:

A <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
A <html> element with:
A <head> element with a page title.
A <body> element with a paragraph.
You now have the blueprint that you can use for all future HTML files!
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Website | Home</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>some code</p>
  </body>
</html>
